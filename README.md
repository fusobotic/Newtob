##Intial Setup##

Make sure you install jekyll, nodejs and gulpjs

then navigate to the directory and run:
"npm install"

node is just for browsersync which is nifty

edit the config to suit your needs
put new comics in post directory named consistently; follow the examples

then start the server with:
"gulp"

put this in a "gh-pages" branch to allow github pages to host
visit your comic via http://[your_username].github.io/JekyllComic/


##Customization##

check out "main.sass" in the scss folder, modify any colors you'd like

use the default.html layout to modify general menu stuff

//add more info down here later
